# Cactus Data Visualization
This project applies some common Data Visualization techniques based on Cactus data found on [SEINet Website](http://swbiodiversity.org/seinet/imagelib/index.php?taxon=Cactaceae)

## Overview of Features

*   Classification based on flower reproducibility( Location wise) ([Classification](index.html))
*   Loc-wise heat map(Chloropleth) - ([Heat Map](choropleth.html))
*   Living Temperature ([here](temperature.html))
*   Family Packing of Species ([Zoomable packing](zoompack.html))
*   Word cloud based on Reproducibility and Occurrence ([Flowering](wordcloud-flower.html), [Non Flowering](wordcloud-no-flower.html))


## Data Collection and Processing
*   SEINet webpage was scraped using python code to get images and description
*   We also collected locations (lattitude, longitude) for each species. Location for some species are missing (collected using Google Maps)
*   For the Living Temperatures of the cacti, there were almost no data in the SEINet website. We needed to collect data missing using location (if a cactus grows in AZ, we took the temperature range for AZ)
*   We used image classification-filter and rotation and flipping to enhance the data
*   We calculated the population based on lat and long as the data is not available with state data

## Classification based on flower reproducibility( Location wise)
*   Two distinct classes (1) Flower Reproducibility and (2) without Flower Reproducibility
*   Images are classified by a DNN
*   Classification Result displayed by clicking on the point
*   Location Points based on the Latitude and Longitude, Description and Image on hovering the points
*   Search by Auto complete

## Choropleth
*   Sequential color used to indicate the cacti population in various states of the countries
*   Sequential is used because it is easier to identify the strength of the population
*   Our state has the highest population
*   Surprisingly East coast states like NY have some cacti too

## Living Temperature
*   We have divided the cacti into three types
    1.  The pot-able cacti i.e which can be grown in the pots
    2.  The creeper cacti, which really grows on groups
    3.  The tall ones which are above 5ft

*   The classification is done manually by studying the species
*   The upper region is the high extreme temp the cacti can survive
*   And the lowers are low extremities

## Family Packing
*   Each cacti belongs to family and each family has many cacti in it
*   To represent the family of the cacti we used zoomable circle packing
*   This helps us to know the cacti and their 'brothers' and 'sisters' better


## Word Cloud
*   Two fun and interactive word clouds, one for each class (flower producing and non producing)
*   The size of text is based on the population of the family

## Instruction for Deploying the Website
*   Prerequisite: need python installed in your machine.
*   Clone or download the above mentioned github project.
*   From the root folder of the project, run the following command:
*   `python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1`
*   You can access it from theweb browser at: [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## References
*   **[SEINet Website](http://swbiodiversity.org/seinet/imagelib/index.php?taxon=Cactaceae):** We have collected all our cactus related data from this website. In order to collect specific details of each of the cactus, we scraped this website using python other programming techniques.
*   **[Natural Earth - Datasets (for Geo Data)](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/):** We downloaded the "Admin 1 States and Provinces" dataset in 'Shape' format and converted that into 'GeoJSON' format using [QGIS software](https://qgis.org/en/site/). Then we pruned that dataset to get the dataset which finally contains only information for the countries in North/Central/South - America.
*   **[D3](https://d3js.org/)** was used for different types of interactive visualization in this project.
*   **[Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/)** Was used to draw the choropleth map.
